# NextJS Quickstart Template

A simple and easy boilerplate for your next NextJS project, to get you started in NO time.

## Getting Started

Install the dependencies real quick:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.jsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Project info

This section is aimed to make you familiar with the structure, and how to quickly get up and started.

### Structure

This project has the following structure and folders to organize and quickly add files and start

- `pages/` folder contains the rendering files with support for auto routing, That is if you have `pages/test.jsx`,
  It'll point towards `/test`.
- `styles/` folder contains all the SCSS (aka SASS) stylesheets for styling pages. Make files with the naming convention 
  of `<filename>.module.scss` with First letter of filename capital. You can also do `<filename>.component.scss` for
  the components you're using.
- `public/` folder contains the images and static assets, other than styling files. If you want to use an image, Here's 
  How you can do it: `<Image src="/test.png" alt="test" />` with `test.png` being an existing image in the `public/` 
  folder.
- `components/` folder contains the various components which can be reused over several places / pages, and keeps the 
  code DRY. It already has a `Layout.jsx` file, containing the navbar and footer linked by default.
  It has the following contents:
  ```js
  <Navbar />
  { children }
  <Footer />
  ```
  This is applied to all the pages, and has a Navbar and Footer as designed in the components folder. Change them to 
  have them applied, or leave them to keep them empty. More info about it below.
- `utils/` folder contains the utility methods for the project. 

### Project layout info

#### Components

In `components/` folder, we'll have a layout Components which will return following things:
```js
<Navbar />
{ children }
<Footer />
```

To have navbar, footer for each page, we'll add them, Remember `Navbar.jsx` and `Footer.jsx` are
components too in components folder, which we import in `Layout.jsx` and use, Then in `pages/_app.js`
which contains the basic structure of an App.

By default, it's like this

```js
const MyApp = ({Component, pageProps}) => {
    return <Component {...pageProps} />
}
```

And after having the layout attribute, It'll be like this
```js
return (
    <Layout>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </Layout>
  )
```

And `Layout.jsx` is like this
```js
return (
    <div className="content">
      <Navbar />
      { children }
      <Footer />
    </div>
  );
```

Children being the page's content, whichever thing is between nav and footer and Navbar and
footer to keep things DRY.

Edit the `Navbar.jsx` and `Footer.jsx` to update the Navbar and Footer, As the layout is defined,
they're Auto added to all the pages.

#### Environmental variables

A `.env` loader has been added with configuration in `utils/env.js` to load the env config. Customize it as you want and
Get started with using it!

#### Scaffolding

This is a way to integrate things quickly into the project with the help of a simple script. I have provided a script
called `scaffold.js` to do the scaffolding, and it supports only CSS frameworks as of now. It's pretty easy to get 
started by integrating CSS frameworks in the projects. Here's the command to do that: `node scaffold.js <CSS-FRAMEWORK>`
And It'll auto integrate the things as needed in the project.
  
## Docker

Docker is an easy way of containerizing and delivering your applications quickly and easily, in an
convenient way. It's really simple to get started with this, with docker handling all the installation
and other tasks. Then, run `docker-compose up` after getting the project and config ready.

**Docker mini guide:**

- Running the App: `docker-compose up --build`
- Stopping the App: `docker-compose down`
- Rebuilding the App: `docker-compose build`

## ü§ù Contributing
